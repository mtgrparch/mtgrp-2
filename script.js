    bio: "Andrew studied architecture at the Lebanese American University (BArch) before completing the Master of Advanced Studies in Collective Housing (MCH) at Escuela Tecnica Superior de Arquitectura de Madrid and ETH Zurich. His research, culminating in the thesis Unframing Collective Housing Through Ideology, informs a practice deeply engaged with the politics of space, modular systems, and architectural ghosts. Operating from Madrid, his work bridges these theoretical frameworks with the mechanics of circularity and metabolism. Recently, Andrew was awarded for the Europan-winning Ruckhalde masterplan in St. Gallen.",

His research moves through the multisensory terrain of architecture and the collective memory held in a place. Charbel operates in Milan, and has been part of studios working on civic-scale buildings in Amsterdam, Milan, the G.C.C. and the Levant. He was awarded first prize in the KWL National Competition in 2019 for the Beirut River regeneration, and recently, has served as a guest tutor at the MIAW – Milan International Architecture Workshop at Politecnico di Milano.",

    bio: "​Nahi studied architecture at Université Saint-Esprit de Kaslik (BArch, MArch). His research circles the phenomenology of building, how architecture is felt under the hand before it is read, and the question of how architecture should be reflecting actions and projecting them, an interest that pulls him toward adaptive reuse and the slow transformation of existing structures rather than their erasure. Professionally, Nahi works on some of the region’s largest developments among them Diriyah, NEOM, and Expo 2030 Riyadh at the scale where computational, formally ambitious design has to survive its translation into something built. He dedicates a significant portion of his practice to research-driven and independent projects, driven by a desire to explore unanswered questions within the discipline.",

    bio: "Joe studied architecture at Université Saint-Esprit de Kaslik (BArch, MArch). His academic research investigates fabrication, robotic production, and mass customization with a specific focus on architectural assemblies and joinery. This academic focus translated directly into applied prototyping as part of the Beirut Makers collective; where he was granted funding in 2022 to build a physical prototype for the group's exhibition at the Beirut Art Center. Professionally, Joe operates between Beirut and the Gulf, applying his technical and research-driven background to large-scale developments across Saudi Arabia and the UAE. His experience includes the development of Qiddiya city, where he leads teams and coordinates multidisciplinary sub-consultants.",

      MTGRP is metagroupe is an architecture practice working at the intersection of thermal conditions, open-ended use, and collective space. We pursue a political approach to material expression — buildings as proposals about how life is organised and shared.
    Our work spans housing, adaptive reuse, urban design, and competition. Across these scales we return to the same questions: how a building manages energy and climate as a social act; how programme can remain underdetermined; how the shared spaces of a building carry as much weight as the private ones.
    We are interested in metabolism and circularity not as technical positions but as political ones — in what it means to build with and within existing material and social structures rather than against them.

In Lysá nad Labem, the households are compacted into a three-storey pinwheel forming an urban edge, whereas in Milovice, the same units unfold into a two-storey horizontal arrangement following the gentle slope of the land.

// ── 7. SMOOTH INERTIA SCROLL ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//  The flip/lag bug happens when virtualScrollY grows unboundedly and the
//  modulo wrapping causes a discontinuous jump mid-lerp.
//
//  Fix: we never let the raw scroll value drift far from zero. Instead we
//  accumulate scroll into a "velocity" variable and apply momentum decay
//  each frame — this gives smooth inertia without ever needing modulo on
//  the raw input value. The per-column wrap only applies to the final
//  visual offset, not to the running total.
//
//  virtualScrollY  = running total (unbounded but normalised)
//  velocity        = pixels/frame remaining momentum
//  FRICTION        = how fast momentum decays (0.88 = natural feel)
